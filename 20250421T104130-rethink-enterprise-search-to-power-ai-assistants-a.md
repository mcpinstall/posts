# Rethink Enterprise Search to Power AI Assistants and Agents (Gartner April 2025) – Summary and Analysis

## Executive Summary

Despite the rise of AI-powered assistants and agents in the workplace, employees still frequently struggle to find the information they need. A Gartner report by Stephen Emmott (April 2025) argues that enterprise search must be reimagined as a supporting capability for these AI assistants and agents, rather than a separate or competing tool. Instead of employees manually searching across siloed repositories, organizations should **embed enterprise search into AI assistants and agents** that proactively retrieve and synthesize information in context. This shift would transform search from an occasional, reactive user experience into a continuous, automated process of informing employees in their “business moments.”

Key findings indicate that information is fragmented across many repositories, existing search tools are often inadequate, and even retrieval-augmented generative AI struggles to perform when scaled to enterprise-wide data. Moreover, most organizations have **poor content governance**, resulting in **redundant, obsolete, and trivial (ROT)** data scattered across systems instead of **accurate, pertinent, trusted (APT)** information. To address these issues, the report recommends enterprise application leaders take a strategic approach: optimize the myriad search **touchpoints** already available, consolidate and **rationalize underlying search services**, and implement strong **content governance**. By doing so, enterprise search can **power AI assistants/agents** that deliver trusted insights to employees at the point of need.

Gartner predicts that by 2028, 80% of employees’ information needs will be met through proactive information synthesis (via AI) rather than through reactive search queries. Achieving this vision will require treating information retrieval and delivery as an end-to-end process – combining robust search infrastructure, generative AI for synthesis, and disciplined management of content.

## Introduction

Organizations today generate and store vast amounts of information across numerous applications and repositories. According to Gartner’s 2024 Digital Worker Survey, about one-third of employees (34%) report that they *“sometimes or more frequently”* struggle to find information needed for their work. This is despite the growing availability of "everyday AI" tools – nearly half of employees (49%) use AI-powered tools or assistants (such as Microsoft 365 Copilot or Google’s generative AI like Gemini) to help with work tasks. **Finding information or data to do their work is the number one reason** employees use these AI tools. Yet even among those using AI assistants, over a third (36%) say they still frequently struggle to locate information. In other words, the advent of AI assistants has not eliminated the information-finding challenge. 

The core problem is that the **insights employees need are often locked away in many different systems and formats** across the enterprise. Traditional enterprise search implementations have been fragmented and underdeveloped, leading to poor findability of data. Meanwhile, new AI assistants that use techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) depend on feeding on relevant enterprise data – but they underperform when applied at scale across all of an organization’s content. The underlying content itself is often in disarray: most organizations have not managed their document repositories with findability in mind. As a result, they accumulate a lot of ROT (redundant, obsolete, trivial) content and lack a single source of truth for important information. This makes it hard for both humans and AI assistants to retrieve *accurate, pertinent, and trusted (APT)* information when needed.

Another key trend is a **shift in how search is used** in the enterprise. Traditionally, search has been a stand-alone, user-driven activity – employees query a search engine or look through files *when* they need information. Going forward, however, search is becoming an embedded feature that *“continuously informs”* users during their work. Instead of interrupting workflow to search, information will be delivered proactively via AI assistants and integrated contextual search features. In fact, Gartner projects that by 2028 employees will get information pushed to them via proactive synthesis (e.g. an AI agent surfacing relevant insights) **80% of the time**, rather than having to actively retrieve information. This vision requires rethinking enterprise search from a static utility into a dynamic, AI-powered information fabric.

**Enterprise Applications leaders are therefore advised to rethink enterprise search as a capability that supports AI assistants and agents, rather than something that competes with them.** In practical terms, this means leveraging enterprise search technology as the backbone for digital assistants and intelligent agents that can fetch and compile information on the fly. The report poses the question: how should search, assistants, and agents be provided to ensure employees have the information they need to decide and act?

## Key Findings

- **Information is siloed across numerous repositories:** Critical insights employees require reside in *“many and varied repositories within the organization.”*
- **Fragmented search capabilities make data hard to find:** Enterprise search and retrieval capabilities are often fragmented or underdeveloped.
- **Generative AI assistants underperform without unified enterprise search:** RAG-based AI assistants and agents struggle to scale across all enterprise data.
- **Unmanaged content leads to ROT (redundant, obsolete, trivial) data:** Content repositories are rarely governed, producing abundant ROT content instead of APT information.

## Analysis

### Automate Information Delivery for Insight

Employees need **insight** – a deep, accurate understanding to make decisions and take action. Generative AI can synthesize information from multiple sources into coherent answers, but its effectiveness hinges on the quality of **retrieval** of source information. Without robust search, AI responses may be incomplete or incorrect. Enterprise search must shift from a standalone experience to **powering** integrated AI assistants and agents, enabling proactive delivery of contextually relevant insight.

### Optimize Existing Search Touchpoints

Organizations often provide **many search “touchpoints”** across applications and platforms (e.g., OS-level search, CRM search, standalone tools like Glean or Coveo). Each touchpoint may rely on different back-end indexes and algorithms, leading to inconsistent results and user confusion. Enterprises should **audit and optimize these existing touchpoints** before adopting new solutions, ensuring that key data sources are indexed and search relevancy is tuned. Additionally, provide **in-app guidance** to help users choose the appropriate tool for their information needs.

### Rationalize Underlying Search Services

The proliferation of search services leads to redundancy and increased costs (licensing, infrastructure, maintenance). While the ideal of a single unified search engine for all touchpoints may be impractical, organizations should **consolidate** to as few search platforms as possible and **retire** duplicates. Establish clear ownership of search and AI services, standardize on central platforms where feasible, and implement **signposting** for unavoidable siloed systems to guide users.

### Institute Content Governance for Findability

Quality of content is paramount. Poorly governed repositories lead to ROT content, duplicate files, and outdated information, degrading both search and AI performance. Enterprises must **establish content governance frameworks**: define ownership and stewardship roles, enforce lifecycle policies (archival, deletion), conduct regular audits, and leverage **metadata** for classification and filtering. A disciplined approach transforms content into accurate, pertinent, trusted (APT) information that search and AI can reliably surface.

## Recommendations

1. **Embed enterprise search into AI assistants and workflows:** Integrate search capabilities into digital assistants to automate retrieval and synthesis of information within business moments.
2. **Optimize and leverage existing search tools:** Audit and improve current search touchpoints, tune relevancy, and guide users on tool selection.
3. **Rationalize search infrastructure:** Consolidate to fewer search engines, assign clear ownership, and retire redundant services to reduce costs and complexity.
4. **Implement robust content governance:** Manage content lifecycle, reduce ROT, and apply metadata to ensure high-quality information for search and AI.
