# Build Anything with MCP Agents… Here’s How

[![Build Anything with MCP Agents… Here’s How](https://img.youtube.com/vi/L94WBLL0KjY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L94WBLL0KjY)

Let’s talk about **MCP** or the **Model Context Protocol**. This has been blowing up recently. A ton of people are covering it, especially on YouTube, but unfortunately, most people talking about this have no idea what it actually is, how it works, and how to explain it in a way where they're not going to confuse the heck out of you. I'm going to break down what it is in very simple terms, coming from someone who is actually a developer.
