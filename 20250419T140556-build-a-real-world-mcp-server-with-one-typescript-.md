This tutorial walks you through building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server from scratch using TypeScript that integrates with real APIs. You'll learn how to create a practical MCP server that fetches EigenLayer AVS metadata from the Eigen Explorer API and processes it using Claude.
The video covers:

Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol) and its advantages over RAG
Setting up a TypeScript project with necessary dependencies
Implementing an MCP server that calls the Eigen Explorer API
Using Claude to analyze and format AVS data in response to queries
Testing the server using the Claude CLI

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have built a useful tool that allows users to get information about EigenLayer AVSs directly into their LLM workflow. This practical example demonstrates MCP's power and simplicity, showing how you can supercharge your LLMs with external data sources.
