0:00 If you're building AI agents, you've probably heard about MCP or Model Context Protocol.
0:05 MCP is a new open source standard to connect your agents to data sources such as databases or APIs.
0:11 MCP consists of multiple components.
0:13 The most important ones are the host, the client, and the server.
0:17 So let's break it down.
0:19 At the very top you would have your MCP host.
0:22 Your MCP host will include an MCP client.
0:25 And it could also include multiple clients.
0:28 The MCP host could be an application such as a chat app.
0:33 It could also be a code assistant in your IDE, and much more.
0:38 The MCP host will connect to an MCP server.
0:41 It can actually connect to multiple MCP servers as well.
0:48 It doesn't matter how many MCP servers you connect to your MCP host or client.
0:53 The MCP host and servers will connect over each other through the MCP protocol.
0:57 The MCP protocol is a transport layer in the middle.
1:04 Whenever your MCP host or client needs a tool, it's going to connect to the MCP server.
1:09 The MCP server will then connect to, for example, a database.
1:12 And it doesn't matter if this is a relational database or a NoSQL database.
1:17 It could also connect to APIs.
1:20 And also the API standard doesn't really matter.
1:23 Finally, it could also connect to data sources such as a local file type or maybe code.
1:30 This is especially useful when you're building something like a code assistant in your IDE.
1:36 Let's look at an example of how to use MCP in practice.
1:40 We still have the three components.
1:41 We would have our MCP host and client,
1:46 of course, we also have a large language model,
1:53 and finally, we have our MCP servers,
1:56 and these could be multiple MCP servers or just a single one.
2:03 Let's assume our MCP client and host is a chat app,
2:07 and you ask a question such as, what is the weather like in a certain location or how many customers do I have?
2:13 The MCP host will need to retrieve tools from the MCP server.
2:18 The MCP server will then conclude and tell which tools are available.
2:23 From the MCP host, you would then have to connect to the large language model
2:26 and send over your question plus the available tools.
2:30 If all is well, the LLM will reply and tell you which tools to use.
2:38 Once the MCP host and client knows which tools to use, it knows which MCP servers to call.
2:43 So when it calls the MCP server in order to get a tool result,
2:48 the MCP server will be responsible for executing something that goes to a database, to an API, or a local piece of code,
2:59 and of course, there could be subsequent calls to MCP servers.
3:02 The MCP server will apply with a response, which you can send back to the LLM.
3:07 And finally, you should be able to get your final answer based on the question that you asked in the chat application.
3:15 If you are building agents, I'd really advise you to look at MCP protocol.
3:18 The MCP protocol is a new standard which will help you to connect your data sources via MCP server to any agent.
3:25 Even though you might not be building agents, your client might be building agents.
